# UMASSCICS160
I created this project for the CICS160 class at the University of Massachusettes Amherst. 
This project is demonstrates my ability to implement linked lists, use lists of any type, and engage with inheritance. 
My implementation of LinkedList allows for objects of type LinkedList to store any type of element. This is why I implemented a class called Node.
Code includes tests for LinkedList.delete()
Code includes tests for LinkedList.insert()
Class Employee and class Student inherit from Person.
